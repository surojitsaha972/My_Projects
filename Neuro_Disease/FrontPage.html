        <p class="aboutdisease"> ALD is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the white matter of the brain and the adrenal glands. It results from the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) due to a defective peroxisomal enzyme. This leads to demyelination, the destruction of the protective myelin sheath surrounding nerve fibers.
